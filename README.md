<h1>A simple list for keeping track of your daily tasks</h1>

I personally use this to keep track of my day, especially days where I am especially scatter-brained.
It has utilizes local storage to keep the data persistant, so you can leave the app and then come back later with your tasks still there.

The UI is generated using the Materialize CSS framework (https://materializecss.com/)

Tech Used: 
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)</li>
  <li>Materialize CSS Framework</li>
</ul>
